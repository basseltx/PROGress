# PROGress
PROGress is a web application that is a companion to GE Centricity EMR software.
PROGress requires Apache/MySQL/PHP.
PROGress also requires custom MEL scripting in the GE application that is included in this repository.
This implementation requires configuration and form setup data stored in the MySQL database that is not included in this repository to function properly.

If you find this repository and choose to try and use the software, do so AT YOUR OWN (and your patients') RISK.
